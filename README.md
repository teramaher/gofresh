# Group Project - Design, Develop, and Deploy a Working Web Application meeting the Requirements Below

## Objectives
* Team demonstrates the ability to be an actively engaged in a development project.
* Team demonstrates requirements elicitation for a web project.
* Team demonstrates effective development and management of a project backlog.
* Team demonstrates the ability to create and manage a release plan for a working website.
* Team members work with the product owner to prioritize the project backlog.
* Team delivers effective regular product owner demonstrations and project retrospectives and sprint planning.
* Team delivers and executes a comprehensive test plan for each sprint.
* Team creates an effective data model that meets the requirements of the project.
* Team effectively manages the code being developed by all team members using Git and GitHub code version control facilities.
* Team deploys a working application. All product demonstrations of new features occur from the remote server instance NOT from a group member’s personal project.

## Approach
Teams of 4-5 students will select a project to develop and deliver. The instructor will play the role of the product owner, but student groups are responsible for selecting a project before the start of class in Week 4.

## Requirements:
* Teams will be required to meet virtually or in person **AT LEAST TWICE PER WEEK** to conduct ‘Stand-Up’ meetings with at least 2 days between meetings. 
  * Notes from EACH meeting must be recorded and saved to a shared Box folder for each meeting.
* At the end of each Sprint period, each team will present their work to the instructor virtually. 
* For Sprints after Sprint 0, groups must include a demonstration of the **deployed version** of the application to the instructor during the presentation.

### Each Project Must Include the Following Components:
* 4 or more Database tables
* At least 2 types of users 
* Several web pages
* The ability to send e-mail notifications
* Deployment to a server - PythonAnywhere or Heroku
* A shared Box folder for all Sprint Documents with folders for each Sprint shared with spawaskar@unomaha.edu
* A shared Trello Board to track work - Share with spawaskar@unomaha.edu
* A group GitHub repository – Shared by **SachinPawaskarUNO** with each group

## Overview of Required Deliverables – 
See ‘3900 PROJECT ASSESSMENT RUBRIC.XLSX’ posted to Canvas with this assignment for a detailed breakdown of the points possible and Presentation requirements.

## Group Deliverables: 
**Use a shared Box folder for documents, Trello for managing tasks, and GitHub for all application code**
1.	**Application and Organization Overview:** a description of the application and team organization
2.	**Use Case Diagrams**
3.	**Data model for the application.** This can be created using the Oracle SQL Data Modeler or other modeling software. 
4.	**Detailed application mock-ups** of all screens to be delivered for each sprint. 
5.	**Project release plan and backlog:** For Sprint 0, the release plan should be complete for the entire project and include all features planned for the project and when each feature will be delivered, grouped by Sprint.
 a.	**Note: The release plan and backlog will be updated as needed as the project moves through subsequent sprints**
6.	**Burndown Chart:** Estimated hours/tasks and completed hours/tasks
7.	**Potential Challenges and How to Overcome These Challenges**
8.	**Team Lessons learned**
9.	**All Sprints after Sprint 0:**
  a.	**Project test plan and results** of all test runs as well as bugs identified in the testing of this project. Defects should be tracked in GitHub.
  b.	**Functioning web application that meets requirements of the product owner.** 
    i.	Each sprint after Sprint 0 must include new features implemented since the previous sprint. 
  c.	**Updated application code pushed to GitHub:** GitHub repository updated with current version of the functioning application code.
10.	**Final Sprint: Documentation and Presentation:**
  a.	**Technical manual** – Explains how this application must be managed on an ongoing basis and installed in a new instance. See an example technical manual posted with this assignment for the Final Sprint.
  b.	**Team Lessons Learned in the Project**
  c.	**Assessment of plan versus actual plan**, (see Project Assessment Rubric for final sprint for details)
  d.	**Recorded Video** in Box of a Demonstration of all Test Cases running against the cloud version of the application
11.	**Formal Presentation – Delivered Virtually – Presentation file posted to Canvas:**
  a.	**Provides an overview of the features to be delivered** by the team for this project for the Sprint. 
  b.	**Includes a discussion and presentation of all items listed above (1-10)**
  c.	Links to all shared components: Trello board, shared documents folder, GitHub repo
  d.	See an example presentation file with this assignment on Canvas.
12.	**All Sprints after Sprint 0: Deployed application** – provide a link to the deployed application with a superuser account created for:
  a.	**username:** instructor
  b.	**password:** Mavericks

## Individual Deliverables:
1.	Individual students will provide a **peer review and reflection** via Canvas of each team member for each sprint
2.	Based on feedback provided by fellow team members, individual students will earn participation points for each Sprint.
